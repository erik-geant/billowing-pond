# GÃ‰ANT Python interview questions and topics

Please prepare answers to the questions below. 
Part of the interview will involve you presenting
your results and discussing them together with the team.

1. Do a code review of the file `primes.py`.
   Suggest improvements to the code or approach.
2. Create a package that can be deployed so that other
   developers can install it with `pip`, and the
   `get_primes` function from `primes.py` can be imported
   and used in their projects.
3. Create one or more unit tests for code packaged
   above, and describe how a CI/CD pipeline could be
   configured to automatically run these tests and create
   a release package.  Propose a branching and versioning
   model for managing the release process.
4. The file `server-cert.pem` contains a pem-encoded
   certificate that is intended to be used for configuring
   TLS on a web service. Discuss the suitability of this
   certificate for a production environment.
